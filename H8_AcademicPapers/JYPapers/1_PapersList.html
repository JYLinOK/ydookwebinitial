                                <b>Abstract:</b> The emergence of GUI is a great progress in the history of computer science and software design. GUI makes human computer interaction more simple and interesting. Python, as a popular programming language
                                in recent years, has not been realized in GUI design. Tkinter has the advantage of native support for Python, but there are too few visual GUI generators supporting Tkinter. This article presents a GUI generator based on
                                Tkinter framework, PyDraw. The design principle of PyDraw and the powerful design concept behind it are introduced in detail. With PyDraw's GUI design philosophy, it can easily design a visual GUI rendering generator for
                                any GUI framework with canvas functionality or programming language with screen display control. This article is committed to conveying PyDraw's GUI free design concept. Through experiments, we have proved the practicability
                                and efficiency of PyDrawd. In order to better convey the design concept of PyDraw, let more enthusiasts join PyDraw update and evolution, we have the source code of PyDraw. At the end of the article, we summarize our experience
                                and express our vision for future GUI design. We believe that the future GUI will play an important role in graphical software programming, the future of less code or even no code programming software design methods must
                                become a focus and hot, free, like drawing GUI will be worth pursuing.

                                <b>Abstract:</b> Competition and cooperation are not opposite, but competition and cooperation are closely related. Competition and cooperation are two very important driving forces for the evolution of natural organisms
                                and the development of human civilization. Since the birth of humans, competition and cooperation have always been accompanied by human existence. This paper starts from the introduction of the earth, the universe, human
                                civilization, and the formation of the natural world. This paper expounds that competition and cooperation are the basic principles of nature, and competition and cooperation are not opposite.Then the paper focuses on the
                                relationship between competition and cooperation in human society. Then the wheel model is established. The wheel model is an inductive model. It can be used to vividly describe the relationship between competition and
                                cooperation. In order to better explain the philosophical principle of the wheel model, the basic principle of the wheel model is explained by introducing the circular motion in physics, the collision of the matter principle
                                and the atomic energy level. Then two common examples are given to illustrate the application of the wheel model. Finally, the conclusion and analysis are given.
